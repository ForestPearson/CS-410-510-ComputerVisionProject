# CS-410-510-ComputerVisionProject
Work done on keypoint detection benchmarking accross multiple methodologies within the field of computer vision. This includes models that make use of NVIDIA CUDA cores as well as depreciated versions of python. to access.

# Models observed
- Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
- Oreitned BRIEF (ORB)
- Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF)
- Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features (BRIEF)
- Local Feature Matching with Transformers (LoFTR)
